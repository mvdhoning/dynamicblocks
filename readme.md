# Dynamic Blocks Mod

This minecraft mod allows you to add dynamic blocks to the game via the mods config file.

Main useage is for using in [modular machinery](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/modular-machinery) machines. Just add a redstone-comparator to the controller to get a redstone output for its state.

## Resource Loader
With [resource loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/resource-loader) you can give those blocks a custom look.

Make a dynamicblocksmod folder under the resources folder and add blockstate json files with the names of your added blocks. Be sure you know how to make [resource packs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Creating_a_resource_pack).
